# Blink detection

## Executing
To run a program you need to execute it like script.
If you want to use it with web cam:
```
$ python detect_blinks.py
```
If you want to use it with video file just add argument:
```
$ python detect_blinks.py --video blink_detection_demo.mp4
```
## Requirements
For correct working of project you need to install libs from requirements.txt and need to download shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat - this is pre-trained facial landmark detector for our project.
